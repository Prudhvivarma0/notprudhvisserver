> **WARNING:** This portfolio runs on pure caffeine, shell scripts, and an unhealthy amount of orange accent colors.

## MISSION_STATEMENT.txt

A cybersecurity portfolio that actually **looks** like it belongs in the field. No boring blue gradients here—just raw cyber energy with:

- **Lando Orange** accents (because why not?)
- Glitch effects that would make a 2000s hacker movie jealous
- A moving cyber grid background that serves absolutely no purpose except looking cool
- Shutter transitions because normal page scrolls are for normies
- A custom circular cursor that follows you around

## THE VIBE

This portfolio is coded with the energy of:
- Terminal aesthetics but make it fashion
- That "I know how to hack the mainframe" confidence


## TECH_STACK.json

```json
{
  "languages": ["HTML5", "CSS3", "Vanilla JS"],
  "frameworks": ["None. We die like real developers."],
  "libraries": ["Courier New (the font of champions)"],
  "external_dependencies": 0,
  "lines_of_regret": "Many",
  "coffee_consumed": "Yes"
}
```

## FEATURES_THAT_NOBODY_ASKED_FOR

### Dual Theme Support
Toggle between:
- **Dark Mode** 
- **Light Mode** 

### Shutter Transition System
Why use normal scroll behavior when you can:
1. Close orange shutters
2. Show a fake "ACCESSING_SERVER" loader
3. Scroll while nobody's watching
4. Reopen shutters dramatically

Unnecessary? Absolutely. Cool? Also absolutely.

### Custom Cursor
Your boring default cursor has been replaced with:
- A small orange dot (you are here)
- A circle that follows your every move with a slight delay 

### Glitch Effect Title
Very necessary for a professional portfolio.

### Hexagonal Certifications
Because normal rectangles are too mainstream. These certifications are displayed in **HEXAGONS** that light up orange on hover. Peak geometry energy.

## FILE_STRUCTURE

```
portfolio/
│
├── index.html (the entire website. yep, just one file)
│
└── Prudhvi_Resume.pdf (not included but referenced like it exists)
```

**Philosophy:** Why split into multiple files when you can have one glorious 500+ line monolith? Modular code is for people with time.

## KNOWN_BUGS_FEATURES

- Custom cursor disappears on mobile (solution: don't use mobile)
- Over-reliance on orange (#ff8700 appears 47 times)

## COLOR_PALETTE

```css
--accent-color: #ff8700  /* LANDO ORANGE (the only color that matters) */
--bg-color: #050505      /* Void black */
--card-bg: #0f0f0f       /* Slightly less void black */
--text-primary: #ffffff  /* Words you can actually read */
--text-secondary: #b0b0b0 /* Words you squint to read */
```

## MOBILE_SUPPORT

**Status:** Technically yes.

- Glitch title becomes smaller (less dramatic)
- Navigation links disappear (use the force)
- Cyber grid hidden (performance > aesthetics)
- Custom cursor disabled
